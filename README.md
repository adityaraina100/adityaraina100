Hi there!
I am C.S.E student who is eager to gather knowledge on different domains and increase my technological lexicon.
Currently the domains that I have set my sight on are  Cloud Computing, cybersecurity and web development.
I try to upload all of my projects that i work on or have completed in the repositories so my repositories may revolve around langauges like Python,C++,SQL,Firebase,HtML,CSS and some other tech staack.
Hope some of my codes help you and I sure do hope I am able to start my own journey in this field and track it here.
